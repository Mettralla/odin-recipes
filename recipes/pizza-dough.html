    <h2 class="recipe section">Description</h2>

    <p>This pizza dough recipe is very simple and only takes about 10 minutes to prepare. I make mine in the food processor, but it is not essential. If you donâ€™t have a food processor, make a well in the flour and salt and pour the liquids to the center. Work with your fingers gradually adding dry ingredients to the liquids. What is important is to get a soft dough and to let it rise in a warm place. Freezes well.</p>

    <h2 class="recipe section">Ingredients</h2>

    <ul class="list">
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="recipe section">Steps</h2>

    <ol class="list">
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine 2 cups bread flour, olive oil, salt, white sugar and the yeast mixture; stir well to combine. Beat well until a stiff dough has formed. Cover and rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a well floured surface. Form dough into a round and roll out into a pizza crust shape. Cover with your favorite sauce and toppings and bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
